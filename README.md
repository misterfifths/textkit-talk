A brief introductory talk about Text Kit.

Uses [remark](http://remarkjs.com/) for the slides. The 'go' script in the root will start a local HTTP server and open the slides.

Also I don't own the image of the corgi in the banana costume. I wish I did. I couldn't find information on its origin, but god, I love it.
